Go to a video on the course page and open the lectures sidebar.
Expand all subsections that have completed lectures on them.
Open your browser's developer tools. You can do this by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I or COMMAND + SHIFT + I or F12 or somewhere under tools > developer tools depending on your browser and OS. (Google it if none of these work)
Make sure you opened the developer tools on the Udemy page.
In the developer tools, go to the console and input the follow JavaScript code.

document.querySelectorAll('li input[type=checkbox]:checked').forEach((box, i) => setTimeout(() => box.click(), i * 50))

***make sure “allow pasting” before input the code into the console***
